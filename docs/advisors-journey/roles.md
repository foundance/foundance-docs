# Step1: Check-out Advisory roles

While founders are used to wearing multitple hats, sometimes they lack experience, skills or knowledge in some areas. This is the time when they seek help from the wisest and more experienced. 

On **Foundance**, founders are able to open permanent or freelancing Advisory roles. The first one means the advisor will be a permanent team member, while that latter that the founders' need is very specific and the collaboration is a short-term one. 

Take the first step and check out open Advisory roles on Foundance. 

If you find one that grabs your attention, apply to it. Might be a good idea to start chatting with the co-founders, as well. 

You can read more on roles and opportunities [here](../tutorial-basics/join-a-project.md).
