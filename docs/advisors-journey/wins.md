# Step 3: Review your earnings

**Freelance advisor roles**

As a freelance advisor, each completed gig will bring in funds, be it project tokens or crypto. 

If the gig was compensated in project tokens, you will be able to review the on your profile, under [Opportunities](https://app.foundance.org/account/opportunities). 

*Coming Soon*: If the job was paid in other cryptocurrency, the tokens you have earned are in your wallet, for you to use. 

**Permanent advisor roles**

On Foundance, permanent team members can be compensated in project tokes, according to each venture's co-founder agreement, or in fiat. 

If you are part of the co-founder agreement, you can always review your equity in the project's [agreement tab](../running-a-foundance/creating-an-agreement/).
