# Step 1. Find an idea you want to help bringing to life

We all have our passions and interests, but not all of us have the guts to just start building, and that is fine. As a co-founder, you play a crucial role in turning **visions into reality**, as a partner.

At **Foundance**, we help you find the perfect **match for your skills and passion**, providing the **support** and **connections** needed to join forces with innovative founders and create something amazing together.

All you need to do is browse for [open roles](../../tutorial-basics/join-a-project.md) matching your skills and interests and apply.

If you find a project you like but they don't have open roles, start a conversation with the founder or [request to join](https://docs.foundance.org/tutorial-basics/join-a-project#no-role-listed) them.
