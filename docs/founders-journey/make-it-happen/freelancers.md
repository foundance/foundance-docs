# Step 10: Hire Freelancers

As a founder, you should always consider working with freelancers because they provide specialized skills and flexibility.

Freelancers are perfect for projects like developing a new app feature, creating marketing content, or conducting market research.

An added advantage is the option to pay in project tokens and crypto, which can be more convenient, offering additional incentives for freelancers.

2. Second, you need an enacted [co-founder agreement](../make-it-happen/agreement.md); this implies, of course, you [having a co-founder](../find-a-cofounder/looking).
3. a [community pool](https://docs.foundance.org/creating-an-agreement/make-agreement#intermediate-agreement) of project tokens or some crypto in your [project's bank](../../running-a-foundance/bank.md).
