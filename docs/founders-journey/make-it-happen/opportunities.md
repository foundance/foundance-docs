# Step 8: Discover Opportunities

Building a venture from scratch requires a lot of time and resources (e.g., computers, subscriptions, office space, etc), which in turn, translates into money. Either you want to bootstrap or you’re looking for investment to accelerate your growth, keep an eye open for opportunities.

## Hackathons

Hackathons aren’t just for people wanting to play around and explore new avenues. These events offer founders a structured environment to focus on their venture, access to diverse talent and resources, opportunities to win prizes or funding, and valuable feedback and mentorship. Depending on the event type, a hackathon might prove a great opportunity for your team to start building a feature from scratch or continue working on an existing one.

On **Foundance**, we are hosting periodically hackathons. Make sure you check out our [upcoming events](https://app.foundance.org/events) – maybe you will find one that suits you!

## Accelerators

Participating in an accelerator can help your team by providing structured mentorship, access to networks of investors and industry experts, intensive business training and workshops, potential funding opportunities, and validation of their business model through rigorous validation processes.

## Venturethons

**We are proud to call these our own creation**.

Venturethons are a special flavour of events, born from our collaboration with [soonami](https://soonami.io/), They are a mix between a hackathon and an accelerator, offering you the best from both worlds: a boxed time frame to build, access to builders, trainings and workshops, mentorship and the possibility of pitching in front of an investment committee.

Interested? Check out [future events](https://app.foundance.org/events?query=venturethon) and [success stories](https://soonami.io/cohort-3) from previous editions.

## Grants

Grants offer a valuable source of funding that can help accelerate growth and development without requiring you to give up equity. They often come with additional support, resources, and networking opportunities and you should definitely consider them in order to maximize your venture's potential.

## Freelancers willing to accept tokens

Don’t forget to keep an eye out for freelancers who are open to accepting project tokens as payment. They can bring a unique perspective and skills that align well with your venture. By offering tokens, you’re not just hiring talent – you’re also building a team that believes in the project’s success. Plus, it’s a great way to tap into a global talent pool while staying innovative and efficient. If you are considering exploring this option, read more about opening [freelancer roles](../make-it-happen/freelancers.md) on Foundance or [check out freelancers](https://app.foundance.org/community?types=55) who are already on the platform.
