# Step 6: Your Cofounder Agreement

Take your team and your project to the **next level** and **sign a co-founder’s agreement**.

This document is key to setting **clear expectations** and **responsibilities** for each of you.

It covers important details like

- roles
- equity distribution
- decision-making processes
- what happens if one of you decides to leave the company.

Having a co-founder’s agreement helps **prevent misunderstandings** and ensures that you’re both on the same page from the start. It’s all about protecting your partnership and making sure everything runs smoothly. **So, don’t skip this step – it’s an essential part of building a strong foundation for your business.**

At Foundance, we are dedicated to supporting ventures without borders. Having co-founders all around the world makes it difficult to sign and enact a traditional contract.

Our mission lead us to implement smart, **on-chain agreements**. Besides allowing co-founders to build remote ventures, they have a couple of **advantages**. First off, a smart agreement is more **secure and transparent** since it’s stored on the blockchain, making it nearly impossible to alter without everyone’s consent. This transparency helps build trust between you and your co-founder. Plus, smart contracts **automatically enforce the terms you set**, so there’s no need for intermediaries, which can save you time and legal fees.

## Step 7.1 Select the agreement type

in order to adjust to your previous experience with agreements and to your business model, Foundance offers multiple [agreement types](../../running-a-foundance/creating-an-agreement/make-agreement.md) you can choose from.

## Step 7.2 Discuss the terms

Depending on the complexity of the agreement type you selected, you will need to discuss with your co-founders details related to roles, equity distribution and governance.

It is advisable all these are discussed and agreed upon before creating the agreement.

## Step 7.3 Configure and Register the agreement

Once all the details have been discussed, [configure the agreement](../../running-a-foundance/creating-an-agreement/make-agreement.md) with the parameters and Register it.
