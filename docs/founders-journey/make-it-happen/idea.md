# Step 2: Refine your idea

## Step 2.1 A detailed description of your project

With your visual identity in place, the next step is to provide **a detailed description** of your project.

This is where you tell your story and explain what your project is all about. Be clear and concise about

- your goals
- the problem you’re solving
- the target audience
- why your solution is unique.

Highlight the **key features** and **benefits** of your project, and share any **progress** you’ve made so far.

Don’t forget to include your **plans for the future** and how you intend to achieve your objectives.

A well-written description will help potential supporters and collaborators understand your vision and get excited about being a part of your journey.

## Step 2.2 Create a visual identity for your project

A compelling visual identity helps your idea stand out and makes it easier for people to remember and connect with your project.

As you're past the first stages, we highly recommend you to providea **unique logo** that captures the **essence of your vision**. Choose colors and fonts that reflect the tone and personality of your brand. **Consistency is key**, so use these design elements across all your project materials and communications.

By establishing a professional and attractive visual identity, you’ll build credibility and make a lasting impression on your audience. If you are not the person to create a visual identity and design a logo, look for a professional who might help you. In this regard, **Foundance** can help you find a [co-founder](../find-a-cofounder/idea) with design skills or a [freelancer](../../tutorial-basics/Building-your-team.md).
