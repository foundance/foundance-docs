# Step 7: Fundraising

Early days of a startup are difficult, whether your intent is to bootstrap or find investment. 

Our mission, at **Foundance**, is to support early ventures. Hence, we are proud to announce the possibility to create **crowdfunding campaigns**.

Crowdfunding isn’t just about raising money—it’s about getting your community behind you, validating your idea, and generating some serious buzz.

## How do we do it?
We help you **generate NFTs** with preset prices in **USDC**. 

The community can acquire these and all the funds will get into your organization's [treasury](https://docs.foundance.org/running-a-foundance/bank).  From here, you can use it to compensate freelancers, for example. 


## Is this for me?

This is definitely for you, if you're:
- **a new founder**: Whether you’re just getting started or ready to grow, Foundance helps you get the funds you need without any hassle.
- **a founder who wants to stay in control**: Keep making the big decisions for your startup while raising funds without losing equity.
- **a founder with big dreams**: Use crowdfunding to show the world that your idea is the next big thing—and maybe catch the eye of future investors too!

## Prerequisites
All the funds from the crowdfunding campaigns will go into your [organization's treasury](https://docs.foundance.org/running-a-foundance/bank). 

In order to get access to it, you will need to setup an on-chain organization by signing a [co-founder agreement](https://docs.foundance.org/running-a-foundance/creating-an-agreement/make-agreement). :::

## Step 7.1: Generate a landing page

First things first: people need to find out about the business idea and the founding team. The best way to do it is by having and sharing a landing page with all this info.

All this is just one click away with **Foundance**. If your co-founder agreement is enacted, you will see on your project page a <Highlight>Generate Webpage</Highlight> button.

Click on it and let the magic happen!

## Step 7.2: Create an NFT collection

Crowdfunding with NFTs is perfect for startups because it lets you raise funds while also building a community of early adopters who own a unique, tradable piece of your project's future.

This means the images you choose to depict your startup must be aligned with your visual identity and your users. 

While setting un an NFT collection is easy, you will need to specify info such as:
- the graphic to use: each collection can use only one graphic for the moment; you can upload an image you already have, use the project logo or look for a [freelancer](https://docs.foundance.org/founders-journey/make-it-happen/freelancers) to create a graphic for you. 
- collection name (e.g., My Awesome Collection)
- collection symbol, which is usually a 3 characters abbreviation of the collection name (e.g., MAC)
- short description (optional)
- number of items in the collection
- price in USDC per item
