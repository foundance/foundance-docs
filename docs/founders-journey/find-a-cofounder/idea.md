# Step 1. Create a Foundance project

The first step on your entrepreneurial journey with **Foundance** is to **introduce your idea to the community**, by [creating a project](../../tutorial-basics/create-your-project.md). 

By **sharing your vision**, you can start building interest and getting valuable feedback from the community. 

Your project page is the perfect place to **outline your goals**, explain the **problem you're solving**, what **what makes your solution unique**, **showcase** any **progress** you’ve already made or the **traction** you already have. 

It’s all about getting your dream out there and starting to build the buzz that will help you move forward.

## Step 1.1 Do you have a name for your venture?

Coming up with a good and catchy name is not easy. Hence, it is quite common for start-ups to change their names once they start growing and the vision becomes clearer. 

If you don't yet have your name, you can explore possibilities with our own [name generator](https://docs.foundance.org/tutorial-basics/create-your-project#a-name-and-a-logo). 


## Step 1.2 Your first logo

In the first stages, you can use our [logo generator](https://docs.foundance.org/tutorial-basics/create-your-project#a-name-and-a-logo) or another provider in order to move swiftly. However, moving forward, we highly recommend you to providea **unique logo** that captures the **essence of your vision**.

## Step 1.3 A short description of your idea

No one expects you to know all the details from day one. However, a short description of the **problem**, your **users** and the **solution** should be provided. This  will help the community take a glimpse at your vision and decide whether or not your project is of interest.
