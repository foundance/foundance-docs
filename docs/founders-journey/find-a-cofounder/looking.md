# Step 2. Find your partner(s) in crime

Your entrepreneurial journey can feel overwhelming, and itâ€™s important not to do it all by yourself. 

As in every good story, having the right mates is the difference between success and failure. A **great co-founder** brings **skills that complement yours**, **shares your vision**, and helps **tackle the challenges** of building a business. They can offer support, new ideas, and extra hands, making the journey easier and more fun. 

Luckily, **Foundance** helps you cover this step, as well.
