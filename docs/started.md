The best thing is, you have already found us! That means that you are ready to build something new and be part of a new global economy.

The process starts from the **Foundance App** which you can access by navigating to **[app.foundance.org](https://app.foundance.org)** where you will be greeted by some public views of the projects that the community are already creating.
