# Finding & Joining Events

A cornerstone of the Web3 ecosystem, hackathons and other Product Development & Network centric events are the best place to meet people, build teams and create Products. Building a community of builders with a breadth of backaground, experience levels and motivation is where Foundance can support in the acceleration of all projects from nucleus of an idea to a first investment round. 

We run 8 week Venturethon events in partnership with our parent company [soonami](https://soonami.io) as well as supporting many events organised by our partner network and customers.

# Browsing Events

As soon as you login to Foundance you will see some of our partner and featured events on your [dashboard](https://app.foundance.org). To see all of the current and upcoming events navigate to [Events Dashboard](https://app.foundance.org/events) and you will be greeted by the screen below where you can see high level details of the event, the organiser, whether it is remote and what the prize pool is.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/events">

![Browse Events](/img/6-browse-events.png "Browse Events")
</BrowserWindow>

On this page you can narrow down the events that you are interested in using the sort, filter and search options.

# Viewing an Event

You can browse the events by clicking on the Hero banner or on the individual tiles. By clicking on an event you will see a page similar to the one below.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/events/2024">

![View Event](/img/6-view-event.png "View Event")
</BrowserWindow>

On this screen you will get an overview of the event as well as details on the topics covered, the prizes offered, the schedule, who the team are - including judges & mentors, and the rules.

Two of the most exciting tabs though are the Particpants & Projects - here you can see the other cofounders taht have signed up to the event and any projects that have been created as part of it.

Use the `Go to Project` and `View Profile` buttons to look at the people and projects you could be mixing with. A really nice feature if you are new to the event is to filter the projects by `Looking for Members` which will show you all projects with open roles that you can apply for - there is more on this in [Joining a Team](/tutorial-basics/join-a-project)

# Joining an Event

Different events might want to gather different information about you as part of the enrollment process, but all of it starts by clicking the <Highlight>Join Hackathon</Highlight> button in the event header.

:::caution Attention
If there is no button it could mean one of several thing:
- The event has finished
- You are already enrolled
- Registrations are closed
:::

If the event does have some enrollment requirements you will be presented with a form in an overlay to complete and submit. Once that form is submitted, you are enrolled, and your profile will be part of the participants list!

:::caution Attention
Once you have joined an event, you are listed on the participants, if you want to be seen by as many people as possible and find the best team for you, make sure that you have a complete profile
