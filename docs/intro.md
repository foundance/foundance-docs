## Getting Started

You can start by learning the **Foundance process**.
Best thing, you have already found us! 
for the record, the process starts from **our dapp** by going to **[app.foundance.org](https://app.foundance.org)**. The next steps are:

### 1. Connect your wallet

This is important, as you will hold your tokens here later on. If you don't have a wallet yet, you can <Highlight url="https://myterablock.medium.com/how-to-create-or-import-a-metamask-wallet-a551fc2f5a6b" color="#FF7900">learn how to create a wallet here</Highlight>.

Once you open the app, you need to authenticate by choosing one of the wallet options, as shown bellow.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org">

then you need to <Highlight color="#F6F5F5" textColor="black">sign a message</Highlight> by clicking the button.
<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/authentication/sign-message">

![Authenticate with Message](/img/1-sign-a-message.jpg "Authenticate with Message")
</BrowserWindow>

To login, your wallet will open and requests for your signature. By clicking the `Sign` you will confirm and authenticate your wallet.

You will not be paying any gas fees to sign and authenticate your wallet.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/authentication/create-profile">

![Create a profile](/img/2-complete-info-email.jpg "Create a profile")
</BrowserWindow>

At this stage, your profile is availabe, but you need to `verify your email` for activating your account.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/authentication/verify-email">

![Verify email](/img/2-complete-info-verify-email.jpg "Verify email")
</BrowserWindow>

To activate your account, go to your inbox and simply click on the <Highlight>verify</Highlight> button in the email that was just sent for you. Once your email is verified, you can access your account and you will be redirected to the your `dashboard`.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/dashboard">

</BrowserWindow>

### 3. Tell us who you are

Usually we believe in identified founders - as it’s just easier for people to put the trust in new friends we can verify. However we will enable anonymous co-founder projects for certain use cases at a later stage of development of Foundance platform. Good tip from our experience is that the better and more insightful is your profile, the more people will follow your ideas. Due to regulatory landscape we need to copy everyday, we have to mention that we might need you to run through a KYC process some time in the future.

To complete profile, got to you `profile settings` by clicking on the `User icon` on the navigation bar. From the left menu choose `My Profile` → `Edit`.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/dashboard/account/profile/edit">

![Complete Profile](/img/2-complete-profile-info.jpg "Complete Profile")
</BrowserWindow>

once you completed the form, scroll down and click the <Highlight>done</Highlight> button to save your profile information.
