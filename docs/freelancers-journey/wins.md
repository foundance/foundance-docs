# Step 3: Review your earnings

As a freelancer on Foundance, each completed gig will bring in funds, be it project tokens or crypto. 

If the gig was compensated in project tokens, you will be able to review them on your profile, under [Opportunities](https://app.foundance.org/account/opportunities). 

*Coming Soon*: If the job was paid in other cryptocurrency, the tokens you have earned are in your wallet, for you to use.
