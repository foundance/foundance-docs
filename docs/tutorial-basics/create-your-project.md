## A name and a logo

If you already have a name for your Project you can type it into the `Project Name` field, however if you would like some inspiration click the `generate with AI` button, wait a few moments, and see what we can come up with matching your description. A list will be displayed beneath the `Project Name` field, simply click one to select it.

Once you have a name, you'll want a logo to make your Project stand out. Again, you can either upload something that you have already created by clicking on the `+` symbol under the `Project Logo` heading or click the `generate with AI` and in a few seconds the logo field will be populated with a logo generated by us.
