# Initial Distribution & Vesting

How much equity do you want to hand out to other co-founders and contributors? A basic understanding of market salaries of participants might help to evaluate the token share.

:::caution Attention
Usually founders want to work on eye-level, so please don't try to outperform your co-founders with _rockstar salaries you wished to have received one day_.
:::

Now you have to decide what is the initial supply of the tokens (it will increase in time as it is in dynamic equity - based on how much work and resources have been put into the project) and how much of it each of the initial contributors will get. For a company at the beginning of it's journey it is usual to start with a small number of token equally distributed, but each case will vary.

You will also need to set a vesting schedule.

Cliff means the time after which tokens will start to being released, vesting period means how long they will be released and vesting cadence tells you how often they are released.

Letâ€™s take an example from the screen below.

Jane, John, and Samantha need to wait 1 year before any token will be released, however, they will get full allocation assigned to them after 4 years from the release time. All of those tokens will be released to them monthly.

:::caution Attention
Dynamic Equity is at the heart of Foundance, you are of course free to use a traditional vesting model as is offered here ad it will work alongside the Dynamic Equity module - allowing some tokens to be distributed on the schedule configured here, and some to be distributed as part of the weekly distribution model setup on the following screens.
