# Look for a team

Working alone is not as fun as working with co-founders, and research tells us that it is not as successful wither. So letâ€™s find you a cofounder to share the journey with!

Go to the co-founder's tab for your project and create roles that you need within your team. This could be CEO if you want to take over a technical side (as CTO), or CPO if you need strong skills on the product side. Not everyone has to be A C-Suite executive, you can add other roles that you deem critical to creating a winning co-founder team, this will differ depending on what your project is - and we will shortly write some blog posts on what we recommend.

## Create a cofounder role

To have cofounders, you first need to create a role for them. press the `+` sign in the `cofounders` tab to create the first role.
