# Define salaries / vested shares

How much equity do you want to hand out to other co-founders and contributors? A basic understanding of market salaries of participants might help to evaluate the token share.

:::caution Attention
Usually founders want to work on eye-level, so please don't try to outperform your co-founders with _rockstar salaries you wished to have received one day_.
:::

In `Fair Market` salaries you define with your co-founders what your salary expectations in the fiat world might be. We usually consider this to be a process of mutual understanding on eye level, as you usually only pick co-founders on a similar level like yourself. Consider you want to start a project with that person and you will gain tokens/equity in the project over time in relation to your co-founders.

:::tip
Please also state wether you want to work full-time (5 workdays per week) or only part-time with less workdays per week.
