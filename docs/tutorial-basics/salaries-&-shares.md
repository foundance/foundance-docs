# Fair Market Salaries & Risk

How much equity do you want to hand out to other co-founders and contributors? A basic understanding of market salaries of participants might help to evaluate the token share. How much cash will be injected into the Project? How do you want to handle the risk associated with the cash equity and the sweat equity?

In `Fair Market` salaries you define with your co-founders what your salary expectations in the fiat world might be. We usually consider this to be a process of mutual understanding on eye level, as you usually only pick co-founders on a similar level like yourself. Consider you want to start a project with that person and you will gain tokens/equity in the project over time in relation to your co-founders.

:::caution Attention
When setting the salaries, use an agreed currency as the basis so that all salaries can be considered as equivalent.
:::

The salary entered here is what you can reasonably expect to earn over a 12 month period. On the following screen you will enter what (if any) remuneration will be attributed to any cofounders as part of the running organization. The difference between the fair salary and the actual salary, multipled by the risk forms the basis of the dynamic equity calculation for sweat equity.

Additionally to that, you can think of multiplier for your theoretical salary, the riskier the venture is the biggest boost you should get for your earnings and your spending. We are able to calculate the risks differently for those putting their money into the Organization, and those putting in their time.
