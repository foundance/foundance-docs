# Congradulations!

Now you will be able to mint your project tokens on a weekly basis from the maximum supply you have chosen. Those tokens will allow you to buy services in the Foundance ecosystem. You agree that the minted tokens for 3rd party contributors will be of value in the future if the project at a later stage flourishes. As a founder or contributor you have to agree that you will not steal IP rights or do any other harmful action against the project or its contributors, including transfer the project to another entity. Due to safety reasons Foundance will ask you to sign a legal agreement for this.

Within the first three months we won’t be available to support you with extra funding. This is the time the bootstrapping is the most important! With your brilliant idea and token which represents ownership in your project, Foundance believe that you will be able to finish all steps mentioned below, which will lead you to Foundance investment board - we're keeping our fingers crossed!

## What are the goals in the next three months?

After three months bootstrapping your company, you should be able to present those aspects of your project to the investment board during 15 min meeting - the course of this meeting will decide if your project will receive fiat investment from Foundance:

1. Concerning the business side, you have clearly agreed on
   - a vision
   - a mission
   - and prepared a litepaper
2. You have selected
   - a name
   - a logo
   - a corporate design (optional)
3. You have defined ways of communication within your team and are willing to show effective workflow using tools like
   - Email
   - Whatsapp
   - Discord
   - Slack
   - ...
4. You have defined a way to collaborate as a team, e.g. by defining a file storage (Gdrive, Notion, Confluence…)
5. You have prepared

   - a pitch deck
   - a businessplan
   - a whitepaper
   - a token economy (optional)

6. You have built
   - a website
   - an app (optional)
   - **optional MVP**: Teams that have built an MVP are clearly in advantage, all teams with MVPs ready will be given higher access rates to funding meetings
