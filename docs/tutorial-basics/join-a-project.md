# Join a Project

You donâ€™t have to have your own idea for the next unicorn, you can find ideas forming on Foundance! You can see all of the projects under development by navigating to the [Project Dashboard](https://app.foundance.org/projects). Browse around, and if there is one (or more) you like, you can check open positions within it and apply for it.

Clicking on `Browse Projects` from the Left Hand Navigation will always bring you back to this Dashboard where you can browse all of the Projects on Foundance and search for the ones that you feel aligned with.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/dashboard/">

</BrowserWindow>

All of the Projects listed tell a little bit of their story on the Dashboard, their name, their logo, a very brief description and the area of impact that the Project is targetting. Importantly though you can also see how many other people are following the Project in the `Watchlist` and, if you're excited to work somewhere, you can get an idea of the size of the team in `Co-founders`. If you see one of the Co-founder icons is just an empty shell, that means that there is a role opening on the project!

Open up Projects that look interesting to you, read the documents that they have shared, explore the team that is already a part of the Project, see what phase they are at, add the project to your Watchlist and if there is an open role, click to see the role and maybe apply!

You can view the current team on the `Team` tab, then click on the `Roles` tab to see if there are any openings at the moment.

</BrowserWindow>

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/projects/10297/role/7M76RL">

![View Role](/img/3-role-details.png "View Role")
</BrowserWindow>

Read about the role, see if there is any compensation, and if you are interested click the <Highlight>Apply</Highlight> button.

Now you have to wait for the feedback, if a project like your profile it will shortly come back with some offers!

:::tip
You can always check your applications (and invitations!) within your profile on the [Opportunities](https://app.foundance.org/account/opportunities) screen.

## No Role Listed

You may see projects which you are excited about but which have no open roles, on the `Project Details` tab within the Project you will see a <Highlight>Request to Join</Highlight> button, click that and the Project Team will get a notification setting up a possible conversation.

## All Open Roles

If you prefer to see all of the projects that have roles available you can navigate to the [Open Roles](https://app.foundance.org/roles) screen and filter the available roles by a particular skill or role in order to help you narrow down the projects that might have something available for you.
