# Join a Project

You donâ€™t have to get your idea for the next unicorn, you can find such on Foundance! Just go to the main page and check all of the projects you find interesting. If there is one (or more) you like, you can check open positions within it and apply for it.

Clicking on `Projects` from the Top Navigation will always bring you back to the Foundance Dashboard here you can browse all of the Projects on Foundance and search for the ones that you feel aligned with.

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.foundance.org/dashboard/">

</BrowserWindow>

All of the Projects listed tell a little bit of their story on the Dashboard, their name, their logo, a very brief description and the area of impact that the Project is targetting. Importantly though you can also see how many other people are following the Project in the `Watchlist` and, if you're excited to work somewhere, you can get an idea of the size of the team in `Co-founders`. If you see one of the Co-founder icons is just an empty shell, that means that there is a role opening on the project!

Open up Projects that look interesting to you, read the documents that they have shared, explore the team that is already a part of the Project, see what phase they are at, add the project to your Watchlist and if there is an open role, click to see the role and maybe apply!

Now you have to wait for the feedback, if a project like your profile it will shortly come back with some offers!

You can always check your applications (and invitations!) within your profile tab.
