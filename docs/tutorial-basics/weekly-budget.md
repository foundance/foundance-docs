# Weekly Budget

You may have expenses outside of salary payment that you wish to convert to equity each week - maybe this is software licenses, or maybe you had to get a train, taxi or plane to a meeting, the weekly budget allows a pre-approved limit to be set on your expenses before you have to seek approval in the [Ad-hoc expenses process](../running-a-foundance/ad-hoc-expenses.md).
