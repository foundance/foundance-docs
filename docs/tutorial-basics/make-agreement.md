# Sign it on Chain

In order to creaate your on-chain agreement every team member is going to have to sign the cofounder agreement to indicate that they agree with the parameters that have been set. As the creator you will do the initial configuration, and commit it to the chain, from which point the other cofounders can come and give their thumbs up.

# Make an agreement

As you started your project, get the idea and team to work on it - there are still some things to do. The foundation of our platform is to ensure all of the people involved in the project are secure and we ensure that with the agreement between them - based on the dynamic equity model. We'll walk you step by step through setting up your agreement.

Remember that all of the steps have to be discussed in detail with all of the cofounders, you must agree on the terms before you will put them on-chain!

The first thing to do is to go to your project tab and check the founders' agreement.

This screen signifies the start of your projects journey to an on chain entity, so we need 3 things from you:

- Origanization Name → `You had a Project, and now it will grow into a organization. The name may be the same, except for technical reasons we cannot support any white space. The name can also be completely different as you and the team may have evolved it! The only thing is, the name must be unique amongst all Foundance.`
- Token Name → `Your organization will rely on tokens to distribute the equity generated and to incentivise external contributors. The token will be unique by the address that it has on blockchain, so the name does not have to be - but you should go for something that represents your Organization well.`
- Token Symbol → `The short form of your token name, make it representative and cool.`

:::caution Attention
These tokens are for internal use only and are not externally tradable. In technical terms they are ERC20 tokens but with restricted transfer semantics. They can be allocated to new collaborators making them defacto members of the Organization and eligible to partake in governance processes such as voting.
