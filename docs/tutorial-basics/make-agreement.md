# Make an agreement

You have identified all the co-founders for now and want to start collaborating? Great, you are at the right spot.

First you have to define how many tokens are minted initially. There can be an initial part of the cake as the co-founders  consider these tokens to be minted for the idea or alreadyn predelivered work. LetÂ´s say the initial cake is `200.000` tokens shared `50/50` by the exisiting co-founders. In the next step the dynamic vesting phase begins.

# Sign it on Chain
After having agreed on an deal and the dynamic vesting this agreement needs to be saved in the blockchain.
