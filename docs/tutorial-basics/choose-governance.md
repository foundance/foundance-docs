# Choose a governance method

This will decide on how your voting system will look like We offer three different voting mechanisms:

- **Proportional**: 1 share 1 vote
- **Quadratic**: Your share-ratio squared will be your voting power.
- **Cooperative**: 1 person 1 vote

There are three types of governance offered by foundance.

## Proportional (One share - one vote)

This governance method is the usual governance method in todays limited or stock companies. The more stocks or shares you own as a co-founder, advisor or freelancer, the more votes you get in the governance of your project.

### Proportional Voting Example:

- Andrea owns 40% of the token
- Tom owns 30% of the token
- Sophia owns 15% of the token
- Rick owns 15% of the token

In an election, Andreas vote is worth `40%` of all votes, so Andrea and Rick together would hold a majority of `55%` i.e. `(40+15)%`

## Quadratic Voting

In the quadratic voting system the token share will be squared to get the respective vote in the election.

- Andreas quadratic vote is `0, 4*0, 4=0, 16=16%`
- Tom quadratic vote is `0, 3*0, 3=0, 09=9%`
- Sophias quardratic vote is `0, 15*0, 15=2, 25%`
- Ricks quadratic vote is also `2, 25%`

### Quadratic Voting Example:

Adding these numbers would only result in `29`, `5%` token cast for a vote. So the result has to be multiplied by `100/29`,`5%=3`,`x`

- Andreas governance share: `16%*3`, `x=50+%`
- Tom governance share: `9%*3`, `x=30%`
- Sophias governance share is `7%` â€¦

Quadratic voting favors higher shares over lower shares

## Cooperative (One Person - One Vote)

This governance method is the usual governance method for associations or cooperatives. Here each shareholder has a single vote, no matter how many shares they own.

### Cooperative Voting Example:

following our above examples, you would need three people (among Andreas, Tom, Sophias, Ricks) to get to a majority vote.

In this voting method, you would need more than half of the people to get to a majority vote.
