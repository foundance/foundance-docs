# Your Profile

At the end of the [Getting Started](../intro.md) process you may or may not have created a profile, here we run through some of the profile basics and show you what a good profile might look like.

What you can see here is your profile - the more information you will share, the more likely people will want to interact with you, share their ideas, or work on yours. We encourage you to fill out all of the empty spaces here as well as add your profile picture, background picture, and social media links.

You can always return and update your profile by clicking on your wallet address in the top right corner of the screen and selecting `go to profile`.

A complete profile will look something like the following.

One of the things that you should notice is your ability to select what Type of user you will be experiencing Foundance as (you are not limited to only one):

1. Founder - You want to create and join projects
2. Advisor - You want to give a little time and a lot of experience to projects, sharing your expertise
3. Freelancer - You want to work on discrete pieces of work across many projects

If you are already involved in some projects on regular basis - you will be able to see your portfolio of tokens (equity) within those projects - but more about it in the next sections.
