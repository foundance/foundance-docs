# Your Project's Bank

Once you and your co-founders enact the agreement and your organization in is place, you will also have access to your bank.

The bank is where all tokens and coins available for spending are. 

# How do I see my bank?

Go to your project, **Bank** tab. 
What you will find on the page:

1. The equivalent of your bank's content in USD.
2. The actual content of the bank, in native tokens and other coins or tokens your project owns.

# How to I get funds in the bank?

At the moment, the bank only supports project tokens and USDC. We will continue to increase our support for different coins.
## Project Tokens
In order to have project tokens in your bank, you need to create a pool for the community. 

When creating an intermediate or an advanced agreement, the [Equity step](https://docs.foundance.org/creating-an-agreement/make-agreement#equity-1) allows you to configure pools. 

If your organization doesn't have a pool or you need another one, you can always create them. To do this, you need to open a [Create Pools](https://docs.foundance.org/running-a-foundance/governance/create-pools) type of vote, under **Governance** project tab.
