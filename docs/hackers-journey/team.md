# Step 2: Find or Build a Team

Usually, in a hackathon, there are two types of participants: those who already know what they want to build and those who want to help others build.

Depending on the situation, your **next steps** on Foundance are a bit different. 

## I want to help build someone else's idea

Since you don't yet have a team, it is essential you focus your efforts into finding the right idea and the right team. 

### Browse enrolled projects

The easiest way to identify projects aligned with your interests is by browsing projects by *category*. To do this, open the **Event Page**, select the **Projects tab** and chose the categories of interest. 

![Browse project by category](/img/6-browse-event-projects.png "browse projects by category")

Additionally, you can apply a filter for those who are actively seeking members. 

:::tip
If the projects which interest you don't have open roles, you can always [request to join](https://docs.foundance.org/tutorial-basics/join-a-project#no-role-listed) them or start chatting with the founder.

### Identify open roles

As an alternative to filtering for projects with open roles on the Event page, you can visit the [Open Roles] page and filter roles by **Event**, **Role** and/or **Skill**.

Once you identify a desired open role, follow the steps of [joining a project](https://docs.foundance.org/tutorial-basics/join-a-project).

## I have my own idea

### My project is already on Foundance

That's great! All you have to do is go to the Event Projects and click on <Highlight>Import</Highlight>. 

### I don't have my project on Foundance

Dont fret, it's not complicated. Follow the steps here to [create the project](../events/join-event.md) and directly into the event.
